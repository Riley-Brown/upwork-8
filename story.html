        <h1>my story</h1>
        <p>My story is that I grew up in the South with the mindset that most people down there live by—go to school,
          get good grades, go to college, get a secure job, save your money. That secure job would be a 9-to-5 job of
          some sort. When you get home from work every day, you eat dinner, maybe go to the gym, and you hang out with
          friends. That’s just kind of what everybody does down there. On top of growing up with the usual Southern
          traditions, I was a total math nerd. I was extremely left-brained and barely knew what a feeling was. I
          continued to get further trained in expanding my left brain when I became a pilot and got my degree in
          engineering. As if I wasn’t already enough of a control freak, I chose career paths that only trained me how
          to be that much more of a control freak.</p>
        <p>So I did the process—go to school, get good grades, and get the secure job—except when I walked into my new
          cubicle after landing a fairly prestigious job as a Top Secret Aerospace Engineer, I felt my soul get
          completely sucked out through my toes. At the same time I watched my soul leave my body, I looked down at my
          body and gawked at the atrocious business casual outfit I was wearing. I knew in that moment that I had to
          find a way out. I couldn’t do the cubicle life, especially one that had bosses. </p>
        <p>I knew I needed out before I ever sat down at my new desk.

        <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
        <p>I spent the next five years exploring everything I could think of as a way to get myself out of my corporate
          job. I knew I wanted out, but I didn’t know how to do it. I didn’t have a particular service or skill I could
          offer as a business and I didn’t have a lot of money to become a big real estate investor. But I kept
          digging. I read more books than most could guess, I attended some weekend workshops about investing or money,
          and I even tried coming up with some small business ideas and pursuing them.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually as my exploration phase moved on, I got introduced to some real estate investing opportunities. I
          didn’t see these as being anything related to getting out of corporate, but rather just some side investing
          while I still had a corporate paycheck. As it turned out, I was so excited about these investments that I
          ended up telling everyone under the sun about them. Eventually those people wanted in on them too, so they
          started buying into the same style investments I was buying. Next thing I knew, I found out that if I got my
          real estate agent license that I could accept referral fees for each person who bought. </p>

          from my investments that I didn’t need to work, but I finally had a solid business forming. I left my
          corporate job arguably too soon as I didn’t have quite the nest egg saved up that I would’ve hoped, but I
          needed the time away from my corporate job to really get my new real estate business off the ground. </p>
        <p>That’s when my entire life changed.
        </p>
        <p>I spent my first year as an entrepreneur on food stamps, typically in a panic most days wondering where my
          next rent payment would come from, and having to drink from the firehose when it came to adjusting my
          overly-controlled mindset. I suddenly had no control. When I flew airplanes, I could make them do what I
          wanted them to do. When I was solving engineering problems, I could make a solution. I suddenly couldn’t make
          anyone buy an investment property. I couldn’t make my business succeed. I couldn’t make a paycheck appear
          when I needed it to.
        </p>
        <p>When I was forced to shift my entire mindset of control to that of one more of surrender, it changed my life

        <p>Becoming an entrepreneur began to show me who I really am. It forced me to change my way of thinking. It
          caused me to change my priorities. While I grew up thinking I always wanted to make a lot of money, I realize
          now that I value lifestyle design over money.
        </p>
        <p> Assuming I have enough money to pay my bills and live my life
          how I want to, it’s more important to me to experience life. Lifestyle design allows me to find the joy in
          the small things in life—saying “yes” to friends wanting to go out to lunch, saying “yes” to random travel
          plans without having to ask for vacation time, sleeping in (which is something my night owl mind always
          craves), being able to create my business exactly how I want to without having to report to anyone, and not
          having to go into work on a Monday morning.</p>
        <p>My real estate company ended up facilitating over $18M in real estate transactions in it’s first five
          years of business. This did not happen without me being flung around on the entrepreneurial roller coaster
          like a rag doll. Today, years after my company first saw success, I still get faced with new challenges in
          order to keep business going. </p>
        <p>Somewhere in the mix of all of this I ended up getting another Master’s degree, this time in Spiritual
          Psychology. Admittedly I thought it’d be funny to tell people I have a Master’s degree in Aerospace
          Engineering and a Master’s degree in Spiritual Psychology and that’s why I started the program, but further
          opening my engineering brain up to a whole other side of thinking, in addition to what entrepreneurship
          taught me, has allowed me to create a life I never saw in my future, but yet one that I wouldn’t trade for
          the world.

        <p>I only share my story, and obviously this is just a vague version of it, in hopes that other people will
          know it’s possible to create their own lifestyle design. Lifestyle design is my passion. I’ve been fortunate
          to figure out what it takes to get it, what it can allow for once you have it, and now the best part is I get
          to work with other people trying to achieve it.
